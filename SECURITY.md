# Elegoo 3D Printer Monitor - Security Policy

## Introduction

Hello, I am the developer behind the Elegoo 3D Printer Monitor. Your security is my priority, and I am committed to making this application as secure as possible. This document outlines the supported versions and how to report any vulnerabilities you may find. 

## Supported Versions

Currently, I am offering security updates and support for the following version of the application:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |

As the application evolves, new versions will be listed here with ongoing support and security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

I take the security of this application seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, I encourage you to report it immediately. I value the collaboration with the community and am eager to work together to resolve any identified issues swiftly.

### Private Vulnerability Reporting

To maintain the security of our user community, I kindly request that vulnerabilities be reported privately at first. This repository has private vulnerability reporting enabled to avoid public disclosure of security issues before a solution is implemented. 

To report a vulnerability privately, please use GitHub's security advisory feature, which can be found in the "Security" tab of the repository. This platform allows us to work together towards a resolution and ensures you receive credit for your contribution.

### Public Disclosure Policy

While I appreciate your eagerness to help improve the security of the application, I request a reasonable timeframe to address the report before any public disclosure. This collaborative approach allows us to mitigate the vulnerability effectively before any public acknowledgment.

## Security Analysis and Updates

I continuously work towards enhancing the security of this application. Periodic updates incorporate the latest security improvements. I encourage users to update to the latest version to benefit from these developments.

## Acknowledgments

Upon resolution of a security vulnerability, I will update the relevant security advisory to recognize your contribution, if you so wish.

Thank you for your collaboration in keeping the Elegoo 3D Printer Monitor secure.
